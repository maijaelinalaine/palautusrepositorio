Retrospective techniques

Start, Stop, Continue, More of, less of Wheel

Used to obtain feedback on team process in order to learn what should be continued or adjusted moving forward.
Process:
Draw a circle divided into 5 sections with titles 'start', 'stop', 'continue', 'more of' and 'less of', Ask 'What should we start doing that perhaps we haven't done yet? What should we stop doing, that's not contributing or is getting in our way? What is working that we want to continue to do? What should we do more of? Less of?' and write down aswers.

Glad, Sad, Mad

Used as a basic retrospective plan, aims to lean towards breadth over depth in discussing issues.
Process:
Participants separately write brief notes on positive and negative observations regarding the previous sprint. They then share their notes by placing them on a whiteboard divided into 3 columns: glad, sad and mad, based on how the observation made them feel. Participants vote on which issues to discuss further, followed by discussion about actions to take in the next sprint.
